    name: "THE SOVEREIGN ACCORD",
    subtitle: "Terms of Service",
    version: "2030.04.1",
    hash: "sha256:8b5cf6e92d04...3b82f6",
    content: `1. THE PROTOCOL: This Sovereign Accord ("Agreement") is a legal handshake between IDEAVALIDATOR LLC (DBA Nexus OS) and the User ("Sovereign"). By initializing a node, you agree to these terms.

2. ASSET OWNERSHIP: The Sovereign retains 100% ownership of all AI-synthesized output (Text, Video, Visuals). Nexus OS provides the neural infrastructure; the Sovereign provides the creative spark.

3. HARDWARE ISOLATION & BILLING: Nexus OS is a middleware orchestrator. All compute costs incurred via the Sovereign's provided API keys (Google Gemini/Cloud) are the sole financial responsibility of the Sovereign. You indemnify IDEAVALIDATOR LLC against any billing deviations on your GCP account.

4. USAGE CONSTRAINTS: The infrastructure may not be used to synthesize:
   a. Non-consensual deepfakes or intimate imagery.
   b. Coordinated harassment campaigns.
   c. Content violating the Prohibited Use Policy of Google Generative AI.
   d. Automated spam that violates target platform (X, Meta, LinkedIn) APIs.

5. NO WARRANTY: The Oracle provides probabilistic simulations. AI can "hallucinate" or provide inaccurate data. IDEAVALIDATOR LLC makes no claims of 100% accuracy or guaranteed viral reach.

6. JURISDICTION: This Accord is governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA.

7. TERMINATION: The LLC maintains "Kill-Switch" authority to revoke node access for any violation of the Code of Conduct.`

    subtitle: "Data Handling & Sovereignty",
    version: "2030.04.1",
    hash: "sha256:10b981...emerald",
    content: `1. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECTURE: Nexus OS is designed for transience. 

2. TEMPORARY PROCESSING: All Live multi-modal streams (Voice/Vision) are processed in volatile TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) memory. No audio or video data is persisted to long-term storage unless explicitly "Manifested" by the Sovereign.

3. PERSISTENT IDENTITY: Your "Digital Soul" DNA and LLC metadata are stored in your browser's encrypted local storage. This data is never used to train public baseline models. 

4. THIRD-PARTY NODES: We use Google Gemini for neural synthesis. Use of these tools is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. 

5. OAUTH TOKENS: Social integration tokens are stored locally. Nexus OS does not maintain a central database of your account access credentials.

6. COOKIE USAGE: We use persistence cookies strictly for node session maintenance (Master Key caching). No tracking for advertising is performed.`

    subtitle: "Refund Policy",
    version: "2030.04.1",
    hash: "sha256:violet...fuchsia",
    content: `1. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS: Subscription to Pro or Agency nodes is a recurring bond.

2. CANCELLATION: Sovereigns may terminate their bond at any time. Access remains active until the end of the current billing cycle.

3. REFUNDS: Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis within 48 hours of initial provisioning. Pro-rated refunds are not issued for partially used months.

4. NON-REFUNDABLE: Credits consumed for third-party API usage (Veo Video tokens, Gemini tokens) are non-refundable as the value has been permanently extracted from the network.

5. STRIPE DISPUTES: Initiating a payment dispute without first contacting Nexus Support results in the immediate "Scuttle" of the Sovereign's node and DNA signatures.`
